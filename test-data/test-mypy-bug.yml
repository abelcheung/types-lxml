# All tests here check for either bug or inhuman behavior of mypy
# If they go wrong, there is happy problem to fix
#

# mypy has a serious problem inferring mapping type;
# it tries to find common denominator of different types,
# instead of using unions. The result is often overbroad,
# like inferring Sequence[object] when we want "str | bytes".
# pyright is doing the correct thing in this area.

# Now is the 6th anniversary of issue python/mypy#3004
# Earlier mypy blatantly emits error directly when checking
# stub for read/write property, when their type don't match.
# Now they pretend to not show error in stub, but becomes
# fatal in checking python code.
