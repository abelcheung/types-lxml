# -- assignment
# Lxml can normalize unicode and byte strings upon
# certain attribute assignments, and outputs a single
# type. Mypy slams door upon such assignments, where
# input and output type for attribute are unidentical.
# See python/mypy#3004 for further discussion.
# Earlier days mypy emits error directly when checking
# annotation files, now they pretend no error exists in
# annotation, yet becomes fatal whenever one uses such
# pattern in real python code.

# -- func-returns-value
# Mypy bans assigning result to func that doesn't return
# value; it even go as far as banning None assertion
# statements frequently used in tests.

# -- TC_HONORS_REVERSED
# Mypy thinks reversed(T) always produce reversed object,
# ignoring annotation completely.
# Mypy groks T.__reversed__() however, just not honoring
# the fact that reversed(T) is T.__reversed__() if
# available.
