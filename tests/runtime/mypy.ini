# Lxml can normalize unicode and byte strings upon
# certain attribute assignments, and outputs a single
# type. Mypy slams door upon such assignments, where
# input and output type for attribute are unidentical.
# See python/mypy#3004 for further discussion.
# Earlier days mypy emits error directly when checking
# annotation files, now they pretend no error exists in
# annotation, yet becomes fatal whenever one uses such
# pattern in real python code.

# Mypy bans assigning result to func that doesn't return
# value; it even go as far as banning None assertion
# statements frequently used in tests.
